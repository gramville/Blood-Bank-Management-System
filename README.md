# Blood Bank Management System

This is a desktop application built using C# and MSSQL for managing blood bank records. The system allows users to manage the inventory of blood, register donors, search for donors, and track blood requests.

## Features

- Register and manage new blood donors.
- Add inbound and outbound records to/from the inventory.
- Update donor records and view their history.
- Manage and track blood requests

## Getting Started

To run the program, you will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 or later installed on your system. Once you have the development environment set up, download or clone the repository and open the .sln file using Visual Studio. Then, simply run the application within Visual Studio by pressing the Run button or hit `F5`.

You will also need a SQL database server management software like SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS) to configure the database. Once done, restore the schema inside SSMS by opening the "Database" menu within SSMS and selecting "Restore Database".

## Usage

Upon starting the application, users can select from different options like adding new donors, checking inventory levels, and tracking blood requests. Users can also search for donors.

For adding a new donor or updating an existing donorâ€™s record, users are required to enter basic info about the donor. Similarly, for keeping track of blood inventory inbound and outbound records must be registered by users.
